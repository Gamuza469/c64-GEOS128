ERRORS
!!! with DBox fix - cannot be loaded in 80 column mode, strange!
- VDC screen positioning dont work
- try binary drivers for 1571 and 1581 for boot
+ replace numbers by register names in all calls to NormalizeX
+ apply all hints
+ change all jumps to kernal table (except diskdrv) by appropriate single underscore jump

IDEAS
+ look if 2MHz can be ON during keyboardscanning (use geoPatch on living kernal)
- look what can be done with relocatable stack/zpage for IRQ (to avoid copying data)
- look what can be done with relocatable stack and PHA/PLA for memory copying/fill functions
- look what can be done with Z80 (and string operations)
- look how Rectangle functions can be used with HorizontalLine without recalculating whole
  thing for each line
- reassemble 1571 driver and look how BURST mode can be used within it

Proposed Layout: bank0

$4800-$4c00	- relocator for those below
$4c00-$5000	- InitKernal code	->$15000
$5000-$9000	- bank1 kernal		->$1c000
$9000-$a000	- bank1 disk driver	->$19000
		    (shadow for #9)	->$0d000
$a000-$c000	- bank0 kernal high	->$0e000
$c000-$d000	- bank0 kernal low	->$0c000
