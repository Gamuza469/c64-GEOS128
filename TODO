- currently system boot has some bugs:
    - no disk init (do OpenDisk before disk calls)
    - auto-exec calls don't work (system error, try GEOS64 booter code)
    - there's no loader, but code could be safely loaded from BASIC (AFAIK)
- reassemble C128's 1541 driver (only Init/DoneForIO should differ), because for
  yet unknown reasons 1541 cpu jams when using binary only code, good enough that
  GEOS64 1541 code can be used for now
- try binary drivers for 1571 and 1581 for boot
+ replace numbers by register names in all calls to NormalizeX
+ apply all hints
+ change all jumps to kernal table (except diskdrv) by appropriate single underscore jump
- look if 2MHz can be ON during keyboardscanning (use geoPatch on living kernal)
- look what can be done with relocatable stack/zpage for IRQ (to avoid copying data)
- look what can be done with relocatable stack and PHA/PLA for memory copying/fill functions
- look what can be done with Z80
- look how VDC code can be speed-up with blitter abilities
